# Foxit PDF SDK for .NET MAUI
------
Foxit PDF SDK for .NET features a powerful, easy-to-use Core API in C# for rendering, viewing, annotation, signing, protecting and managing forms in PDFs. This sample project works with the  `Foxit PDF SDK for Android/iOS` and is a direct port of the `complete_pdf_viewer`  sample project included in the RDK.

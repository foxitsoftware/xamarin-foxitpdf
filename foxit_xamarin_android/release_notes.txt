New features in PDF Core API 6.0:

* Make a font as an embedded font
Related API:  Font foxit::common::Font::Embed
* Added API function to delete an Associated file
Related API: void foxit::pdf::AssociatedFiles::RemoveAssociatedFile
* Provide default Signature handler
There is no new API specific function for this, but the current default security handler was improved. Currently, GSDK supports two types of signature filter/subfilter:
£¨1£© filter : Adobe.PPKLite             subfilter: adbe.pkcs7.detached
£¨2£© filter : Adobe.PPKLite             subfilter: adbe.pkcs7.sha1
If you uses one of them in their signature, they don't need to register a security validation code, the signature validation is in-built by default and will work automatically.

Essentially, this makes it very easy for users with less IT know-how to securely sign documents without having to develop a customized signature validation code. 

Enhancement/BugFixes at core APId

* Improvement in the API reference 
* Enhance the rendering with some special file
* Fix a signature verify issue (add a method called IsNeedPadData() to Signature callback)
* Fix a bug related to form fill feature

Update to PDF Core API:

With the release of version 6.0, Foxit PDF SDK for iOS, Android and UWP now uses the same Core API as Foxit PDF SDK for Windows, Mac and Linux. This means that you can develop with a consistent API across all supported platforms and also that all functionality that was previously available on Windows, Mac and Linux is now supported in iOS, Android and UWP. The detailed list of new functionality available in the Core API with the release of version 6.0 is detailed below.

New features in PDF Core API 6.0:

____High Level Improvements____

* New support for XFA form fields
* PDF v2.0 support
* ConnectedPDF support
* Lifecycle management for page/document objects is now handled internally
* Consistent feature set and API across all platforms
* Includes all Foxit PDF SDK v5.0 features
* v6.0 has one standard package with four add-ons
* Indexed Full-Text Search support

____Add-Ons____

The Standard package includes many standard features such as PDF rendering, editing, annotating, AcroForm form fields, etc, and for specialized features there are currently four Add-Ons provided:

* XFA Add-on = foxit::addon::xfa 
* Redaction Add-on = foxit::addon::Redaction 
* ConnectedPDF Add-on: foxit::addon::ConnectedPDF 
* RMS Add-on: foxit::pdf::RMSEncryptData, foxit::pdf::RMSSecurityCallback, foxit::pdf::RMSSecurityHandler

____New Features____

** Unencrypted wrapper document (PDF 2.0) **

Unencrypted wrapper document is a new feature of PDF 2.0, in v6.0, Foxit PDF SDK support to save the PDF with this new feature.

Related API = foxit::pdf::Doc::StartSaveAsPayloadFile

** 256-bit AES encryption support (PDF 2.0) **

Related API = foxit::pdf::SecurityHandler

** Associated Files (PDF 2.0) **

In PDF 2.0, a new concept named "Associated files" is defined. Associated files provide a means to associate content in other formats with objects of a PDF file and identify the relationship between the content and the objects. Such associated files are designated using file specification dictionaries (known as file specification). Associated files could be linked to the PDF document's catalog, a page dictionary, graphics objects, structure elements, XObject, DParts, an annotation dictionary and so on. Specially, associated files with graphics objects means to be associated with the marked content item.

Class AssociatedFiles is the class for managing associate files. It offers the functions to count/get associate files in PDF dictionary or graphics object, to associate files (represented by FileSpec) with catalog, PDF pages, graphics objects, form XObject objects, annotation objects and so on.

Related API = foxit::pdf::AssociatedFiles cass

** XFA Add-On **

XFA forms are XML-based forms, wrapped inside a PDF.  It can be also used in PDF files starting with PDF 1.5 specification. XFA specification is referenced as an external specification indispensable for the application of ISO 32000-1 specification (PDF 1.7). XML Forms Architecture was not standardized as an ISO standard. XFA defines static forms (since XFA 2.0 and before) and dynamic forms (since XFA 2.1 or 2.2). In this version Foxit PDF SDK supports the filling of both static and dynamic XFA forms. 

Related API = foxit::addon::xfa 

** ConnectedPDF Add-On **

In Foxit PDF SDK 6.0 we have begun to make available some API's for adding ConnectedPDF functionality into third-party applications. Please contact sales@foxitsoftware.com if you are interested in trying the ConnectedPDF Add-On.
